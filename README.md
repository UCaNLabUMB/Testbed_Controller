# Testbed Controller
This repository is meant to be the the central location of configuration scripts used for UCaN Lab's Testbed Controller. This tool is designed to analyze the impact of data offloading across multiple service sets under various scenarios. Rather than using real world devices with various internet based applications, these data rates will be emulated by Raspberry Pi's since these devices are easy to control/manipulate than commercial devices. The documenation of this repository includes how to setup a single Raspberry Pi that is specific to the Testbed network and the scripts required to run various service set scenarios.
