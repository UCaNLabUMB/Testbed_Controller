# Testbed Controller
This repository is meant to be the the central location of configuration scripts used for UCaN Lab's Testbed Controller. This tool is designed to analyze the impact of data offloading across multiple service sets under various scenarios. Rather than using real world devices with various internet based applications, these data rates will be emulated by Raspberry Pi's since these devices are easy to control/manipulate than commercial devices. The documenation of this repository includes how to setup a single Raspberry Pi that is specific to the Testbed network and the scripts required to run various service set scenarios.

The content of this repository includes documentation that covers how to setup the individual devices that make up this testbed and the scripts that perform the core functionality before incorporating a GUI. The `Documentation` folder shows how to configure the Raspberry Pi's and the computer that will function as the Testbed Controller before running performance tests.
